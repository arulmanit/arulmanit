### Hi there! I'm Arul 👋
------------------------------


I am an Epidemiologist at [IQVIA Germany](https://www.iqvia.com/de-de/locations/germany/solutions/real-world-evidence/nicht-interventionelle-studien), working with the Observational Studies team within the Epidemiology and Biostatistics unit.  I am also pursuing my doctoral studies at [Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS](https://www.bips-institut.de/en/index.html?tx_kesearch_pi1%5Bpage%5D=66&tx_kesearch_pi1%5BsortByDir%5D=desc&tx_kesearch_pi1%5BsortByField%5D=title&tx_kesearch_pi1%5Bsword%5D=phd&cHash=553833ad5d8730c4943860c642f305f7). My PhD research focuses on thyroid disorders and their trends in Germany using the data from the German health insurance claims database - [German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD)](https://www.bips-institut.de/en/research/research-infrastructures/gepard.html). 

My research interests are cancer epidemiology, public health, and pharamacoepidemiology.

I would be happy to open for collaboration and advance science. Feel free to reach out at arulmani.thiyagarajan@gmail.com!
