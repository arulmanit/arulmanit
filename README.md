I am an Epidemiologist at IQVIA Germany, working with the Observational Studies team within the Epidemiology and Biostatistics unit.  I am also pursuing my doctoral studies at Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS. My PhD research focuses on thyroid disorders and their trends in Germany using the data from the German health insurance claims database - [German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD)](https://www.bips-institut.de/en/research/research-infrastructures/gepard.html). 

My research interests are cancer epidemiology, public health, and pharamacoepidemiology.

I would be happy to open for collaboration and advance science. Feel free to reach out!
